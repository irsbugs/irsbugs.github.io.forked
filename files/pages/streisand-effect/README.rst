This is to support Jeremy's already published links.
----------------------------------------------------

This directory has html files that support already published links.

For example, Jeremy published two links on Craig Murrays website in the post:

https://www.craigmurray.org.uk/archives/2025/02/united-nations-censures-uk-over-abuse-of-terrorism-act-against-journalists-and-activists/comment-page-1/#comments

Jeremy provided these two links in his post:

* http://jeremydaw.github.io/pages/streisand-effect/uk-police.html
* http://jeremydaw.github.io/pages/streisand-effect/terrorism.html

With the Nickola website generator it is possible to place these folders and files and these published links will still work.
